            <h1>$7/mo Voicemail - Simple Pricing - No Contracts</h1>
            <p>Have callers dial the stand-alone voicemail number directly, call-forward calls to it from another
                phone(s), or even run a toll-free number into it. It is also a great choice for inexpensive number
                parking. Our standard voicemail has up to a 3 minute greeting and callers can leave up to a 3 minute
                message. We also provide greeting only voicemails. It takes unlimited messages and stores up to 200 at
                any one time for up to 4 weeks. Retrieve messages from any phone. Receive free e-mail message
                notification with the time, date, length of message, .wav file, and originating party caller-id.

                You can also choose Telephone Message Delivery to call you at any phone and play new messages for an
                extra $2 per month, flat-rate, unlimited use.

                We also provide SMS forwarding to either your email address or phone number for an extra $1 per month,
                flat-rate, unlimited use.

                Our voicemail service is also excellent for telephone number parking after porting your existing number
                to Copycall.

                Voicemail is $7 per month, $9 per month with Telephone Message Delivery, $8 per month with SMS
                forwarding, or $10 for both Telephone Message Delivery and SMS forwarding. All are recurring
                subscription monthly billing and cancellable at any time. Please keep a valid charge card with us to
                prevent service interruption. To get started, pick a number from our number table, choose "All Calls to
                Voicemail", make payment and it will be active, shortly.

                Unlimited use does not include such out-of-the-ordinary applications as telemarketing campaigns,
                automated dialers, chat-lines, hotlines, premium-rate numbers, correctional facility calling, etc.. If
                it does, you will need to contact us to work-out an arrangement. We all know what normal use is and we
                are reasonable.</p>
